# Features changelog

One full-stack feature per scheduled maintenance run, newest first.

## 2026-10-20 · Trending now

**Backend.** `src/pipeline/trending.js` counts, for every company, person and
theme the classifier knows (OpenAI, Nvidia, Regulation, Funding, …), the
distinct news items mentioning it in the recent window and compares that with
its pace over the 24 hours before. Score = log2(1 + count) × lift, where lift =
(count + 1) / (expected + 1). A topic needs at least 3 items from 2+ sources,
so one prolific feed can't make a trend. Each topic carries a 24-hour
sparkline in 2-hour buckets. The 6-hour view ships inside the snapshot (works
for static hosting too); `GET /api/trending?hours=1|3|6|12|24` serves other
windows, cached per snapshot version with an ETag. Entity extraction per item
is memoized, so it adds ~1 ms to a rebuild.

**UI.** A "Trending now" strip above the lead story: ranked cards with name,
sparkline, story count and lift ("4.5×"). Clicking a card filters the river to
that entity (click again or "Show all stories" to clear); 3h / 6h / 24h chips
switch the window.

**Motion** (all transform/opacity, all off under `prefers-reduced-motion`):
- trending cards rise in with a stagger and their sparklines sweep in;
- new stories rise in, staggered, while stories already on screen stay still;
- skeleton placeholders shaped like story cards with a sweeping highlight;
- View Transitions cross-fade between tabs and filters where supported;
- odds bars now scale with `transform` and glide from the previous value when
  a market moves; the percentage ticks up or down once.
